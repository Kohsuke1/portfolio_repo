            On an alien world where survival of the fitest is rule.  The jellyfish-creature must eat to evolve and become the predator.
        </h3>
        </div>
    <div class="intro-ps">
        <p>Medusa, the animation short, starts on an alien world where everything looks to be made out of flesh including planet matter.  We see a little jellyfish-like organism peer out of one of the trees looking around for food.  However, it isn't the only organism look for something to eat.</p>
      <p>A pterodactyl-like creature emerges from the forest backdrop, spots the little jellyfish like creature, and lets out a blood-curdling cry to signal the hunt.  Startled by the cry, the jellyfish-like organism makes a run for it, and the chase begins</p>
        <p>It loses the pterodactyl-like creature by hinding behind a tree.  Scared and hungry, it looks around for the predator and for some food, and luckily a smaller worm-like organism crosses the it's path.</p>
        <p>The jellyfish-like creature stretches it's tentacle out to snatch the worm-like organism and stuffs it into it's mouth.  It then evolves into a larger and more capable organism.  It feasts some more to continue it's transformation and eventually runs into the pterodactyl-like creature again.</p>

                <p><strong>First</strong>, we illustrated and drew each frame with pencil so that mistakes can be easily corrected. After completing the pencil illustrations, we needed to stencil it over with a sharper or heavy marker so that the scanner can pick it up clearly as it made a digital copy. <strong>  Next</strong>, we colored each illustrations in photoshop pixel by pixel, and then animated each scene of the characters with DigiCel Flipbook.<strong>  Lastly</strong>, compiled in Adobe After Effects for the background and sound.</p>
