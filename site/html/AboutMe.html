    <h1 id="aboutmeH1">About Me</h1>
      <p>I enjoy sketching, free drawing, painting, 3D modeling and coding.  My workevolves around animation, movie films and still picture graphic or
          hand drawn art.  To create a piece of work that emotionally moves people, instilling a sense of wonder and imagination to the viewer.<br>
 
          In my last two years of high school, I studied animation and gaming design at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE), where I acquired and developed various artistic, software and design skills.  I learned different 2D animation software programs, including Flipbook, ToonBoom, Autodesk Maya as the 3D modeling and animation software, to creating games (as well as learning to code) in Unity game engine.<br>
 
          Presently enrolled at the University of Washington Bothell to further my knowledge in the area of web media and technology.  My studies includes a courses in computer programming using java and website and media 
          designs.

First I will work on the pages listed on the menu-navigation bar on top.  Under the works tab of my wix site, it becomes a drop down menu bar as you hover your mouse over, I will script this with javascript.  Then I will make the pages listed under the dropdown menu under the <q>work</q> tab.</td>

                  <td><h2>What to take away from my portofolio?</h2> Please view the gallery of my art work at your leisure.  However from a artist who is trying to sell himself out there, I'd like you to pay attention to all my work and the variety of skill I utilize to create these products.  From art on hard paper with pencils, paint and paintbrushes to using technology aided designs, coding, and use of other artistic software.</td>
